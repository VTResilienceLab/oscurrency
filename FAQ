FAQ: Why do you ask for donations in cash if you're building a non-monetary system? 

  Some people call projects like ours "alternative currency". Legally and philsophically, we are not this. 
  Legally, mutual credit is a type of accounting system that was made legal via The Exchange and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.
  Philosophically, we aren't a complete alternative to the banking system but a complement to it. Many people who use OSCurrency via
  one of our partner networks, use cash or other national currencies as part of the transaction (aka a 'split-tender') transaction. 
  Which is a long way of saying OSC is built to handle multiple monetary and payment systems and our operations and expenses
  are also demonated in multiple payment systems and currencies. Some of the same expenses we have that you have (hosting, taxes,
  postage, platform fees) are only payable in US money, so we ask for small donations here and there to help cover those. 



FAQ: Is this a blockchain project?

No. We are mutual credit. Mutual credit takes 2 forms in the United States: Business Trade Networks (price-based and taxable) 
and Time Banks (time-based and volunteer led). Both of those have existing legal and tax compliance issues going back as far 
as The Exchange and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Since our US partner projects using our code must be compliant to those laws
and regulations, we are maintaining our stable code as mutual credit.  

We are in learning and observation mode with blockchain and are following many interesting projects! As our R+D arm grows, we hope 
to find ways to learn how these two legally different forms of payment and exchange can collaborate.
